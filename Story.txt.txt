Usually my day starts at 6-30 a.m. At 6:45 I wake up my kids and we start getting ready for school. At 8-15 I put them on the bus.Then I clean the kitchen and play with my youngest daughter for almost an hour. Then comes the time to make lunch for us. My little girl eats very slow, so it takes us almost an hour to be done with it. After lunch we spend 40 minutes outside. When we return home we read a few books and then I put my daughter for a nap. Now my time to do something around the house or read a book myself. After my older girls come home from school, I start cooking dinner and help them with thier homework. Dinner is ready around 6 p.m. After that it is time to relax, we read books, play or watch TV. At 8 p.m. girls are getting ready to go sleep. My girls like when we read books together, so it is part of our everyday routine too. And probably favorite part of the day too. My 4 year old is the challenge. Se has developed a fear of her bedroom and we have tried everything to revert back to the happy routine that was once “bedtime”. For the extra hour that she is up we play games, do a puzzle, watch a show or just visit until 9:00 p.m.. We then head to her bedroom and read a few books, share a couple thoughts, say prayers, but now one of us has to lay with her until she falls asleep. I have also put the nightlight. I feel like we had a pretty rock solid routine for 4 years, and in the past 2 months it has gotten a little out of control.I know it is just a phase, but 1.5 hour long bedtime is certainly exhausting. Good thing that my older girls are pretty independent now, so they use this time for reading their books. After we done with putting down kids, we finally have time to enjoy our evening too.
